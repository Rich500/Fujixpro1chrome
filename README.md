The original, and classic, fuji xpro1 lacks the popular chrome colour profile. Additionally, many of the profiles found on photography forums are lost to digital rot.

FujiChrome_xpro1.dcp is a combination of 
[abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles](https://github.com/abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles) and an adobe xpro1 profile.

*alternatively* just use this recipe:

```PRO Neg. Std
Dynamic Range: DR200
Highlight: +1
Shadow: +1
Color: +1
Sharpness: 0
Noise Reduction: -2
White Balance: Auto, 0 Red & -1 Blue
```
